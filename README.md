1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.  

No. Because unit testing is best suited for testing small, isolated pieces of code. The "message" feature, encompassing writing and sending messages, likely involves interactions between multiple systems. 

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.  

Yes. Because it is a specific, isolated functionality that can be tested independently of other parts of the application. The unit test can easily simulate entering text and verify whether the application correctly enforces the 80-character limit.
